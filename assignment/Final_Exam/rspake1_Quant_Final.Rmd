## Final Exam - Student Allocation

In this assignment, we are tasked with assigning 12 students to four groups, 3 students to a group, and based off of three factors that we decide. 

```{r students}
library(lpSolveAPI)
Ip_staff <- read.lp("C:/Users/rspake1/Desktop/Final_Quant_Exam.lp")

Ip_staff

solve(Ip_staff)
get.objective(Ip_staff)
get.variables(Ip_staff)
get.constraints(Ip_staff)
```
